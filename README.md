# Password-Gen












Created a random password generator that would give the user a random password at a length of their choosing.

The generator will ask the user which type of characters they would like to include in their generated password.

When they click "Generate Password" they begin qualifying their password.

They are first asked how long of a password they would like. It may range anywhere from 8-128 characters.

Then they are presented a sequence of confirms. This is asking the user if they want to include numbers, Uppercase, lowercase, and speical characters.

I wrote a function so that when a user give their response if they do indeed want that type of character, it is added to the randomized password character options.

I also wrote an alert that if for somereason the user does not say yes for any of the character types they will be asked to make sure they pick atleast one and the confirms are presented to the user again.

When all questions are responded to a random password fitting the critera will be generated.

The randomly generated password will appear in the box on the page.
